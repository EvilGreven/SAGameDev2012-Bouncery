SAGameDev2012-Bouncery
======================

A very basic game for SomethingAwful's 2012 GameDev challenge, didn't end up spending much time on it.
The game uses Windows GDI to render, which simplifies things a bit.
The game (and the bitmap/WAV files) can be found at http://www.evilgreven.net/GameDev/SA2012/Bouncery.zip
